# ReadSpace
Read Space is an application where readers can track their book’s progress, read book’s description, join clubs and chat with like-minded people. In our project, readers can read the book’s description, add comments on the book, add book to “wants to read”, “in progress” or “finished” section. Moreover, readers can join multiple clubs and chat with club members.
